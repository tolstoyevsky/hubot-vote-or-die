# hubot-vote-or-die

Hubot script for building polls for your [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat) users.

The name of the script was inspired by the song «[Vote or Die!](http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Vote_or_Die!)» from the South Park episode «[Douche and Turd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douche_and_Turd)».

## Features

* Emojis-based.
* The bot prepares in advance all the necessary emojis (`:zero:`, `:one:`, `:two:`, etc), putting them under the polls to simplify searching for them to vote.
